# Project Proposal

**Team Name:** Awesome Possum

**Group Members/Roles:**

(1) Rebecca Pham (Plots)

(2) Ronald Clarke (Clean the data)

(3) Hanieh Babaee (Finding Datasets and extracting from API) 

(4) May Lacdao (Observations/Identify Relationships)

The data our group plans to explore are retail datasets primarily focusing on better understanding the dynamics of online conversion and customer behaviour. 
We’ll be examining the relationship between sale price and regular price. Other variables we’ll be analysing are location, the product item, temperature and the time of 
purchases to determine if there are any relationships and extract any insightful findings.

## Project Proposal Outline

**Brief summary of interests and intent:**

The data our group is interested in are retail datasets primarily focusing on online conversion and customer behaviour.

<br />

**Possible questions to ask for the data:**

(1) What effect does regional temperature have on weekly sales?

(2) What effect does regional fuel prices have on weekly sales?

(3) What effect does the regional unemployment rate have on weekly sales?

(4) What effect does special holiday weeks have on weekly sales?

(5) How does regular retail price vs markdown price affect weekly sales?

(6) How does markdown affect consumer price index?

<br />

**Possible source for such data:**

(1) Openweather API (For temperatures) 

(2) Kaggle.com: https://www.kaggle.com/naresh31/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting

(3) Walmart API: https://developer.walmartlabs.com/docs

(4) JSON: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/anonymous/83803696b0e3430a52f1/raw/29f2b252981659dfa6ad51922c8155e66ac261b2/walmart.json
